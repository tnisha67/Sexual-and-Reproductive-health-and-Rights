# Sexual-and-Reproductive-health-and-Rights

This visualization tackles a dataset that reveals the challenges facing women and girls in Low and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in getting access to contraception and   and sexual and reproductive health services. The unmet need for contraceptives remains high in many situations and is the most highest among the vulnerable sections of the society namely: adolescents, poor people, people living in rural and urban slums, people with HIV, and internally displaced people and thus need is greatest where the risk of maternal mortality is highest.

The dataset uses the categories of modern and traditional to distinguish between contraceptive methods with higher and lower use-failure rates. Modern methods include male and female sterilization, hormonal methods, IUDs, male and female condoms, modern fertility-awareness methods, and other supply methods. Traditional methods include periodic abstinence methods, withdrawal, and folk methods.
